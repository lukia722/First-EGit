Parcel is a serialization mechanism provided by Android. 
In order to write an object to a parcel, that object should implement the interface "Parcelable".

Implement a Parcelable object in an Android application to pass complex data from one activity to another activity.

In order to define a custom parcelable class, wee need to implement the the interface Parcelable in the class
and it must override the methods "describeContents()" and "writeToParcel(Parcel dest, int flags)".
It is also necessary to create a public static member variable "CREATOR" that should implement the interface "Parcelable.Creator<T>".

AddActivity: Using the MemoryItem object has to set the value for each filed.

						MemoryItem memoryItem = new MemoryItem();
						memoryItem.setDate(mDate);
						memoryItem.setTime(strTime);

set a object --> memoryItem						
						bundle.putParcelable("MemoryItem",memoryItem);
						
DisplayActivity: Getting the MemoryItem from Bundle
		
		Bundle bundle = getIntent().getExtras();
		MemoryItem memoryItem = bundle.getParcelable("MemoryItem");
		
		
displaying the value for each filed		
		
		txtDate.setText(memoryItem.getDate());
